title: "Tunnel Api"

The `tunnel-api` sub-command can be used to access an on-premise cluster from a cloud cluster. The intention is to allow orchestrating migrations from on-premise clusters using MTC where access is not possible otherwise.

To provide access an openvpn client on the on-premise cluster will connect to a server running on the cloud cluster. The openvpn server is exposed to the client using a load balancer address on the cloud cluster. 

A service created on the cloud cluster is used to expose the on-premise clusters API to MTC running on the cloud cluster.

## Requirements

- The system used to create the VPN tunnel must have access and be logged in to both clusters.
- It must be possible to create a load balancer on the cloud cluster
- An available namespace on each cluster to run the tunnel in. This should not be created in advance

<b>Note:</b> To connect multiple on-premise source clusters to your cloud cluster you should use a separate namespace for each.

## api-tunnel options

- namespace: The namespace to launch the VPN tunnel in, defaults to `openvpn`
- destination-context: The cloud destination cluster context where the openvpn server will be launched. 
- destination-image: The container image to use on the destination cluster. Defaults to quay.io/konveyor/openvpn:latest
- source-context: The on-premise source cluster context where the openvpn client will be launched.
- source-image: The container image to use on the source cluster. Defaults to quay.io/konveyor/openvpn:latest
- proxy-host: The hostname of an http-proxy to use on the source cluster for connecting to the destination cluster
- proxy-pass: The password for the http-proxy. If specified you must also specify a username or it will be ignored.
- proxy-port: The port the http-proxy is listening on. If no specified it will default to 3128
- proxy-user: The username for the http-proxy. If specified you must also specify a password or it will be ignored.


### Example

```
crane tunnel-api --namespace openvpn-311 \
      --destination-context openshift-migration/c131-e-us-east-containers-cloud-ibm-com/admin \
      --source-context default/192-168-122-171-nip-io:8443/admin \
      --source-image: my.registry.server:5000/konveyor/openvpn:latest \
      --proxy-host my.proxy.server \
      --proxy-port 3128 \
      --proxy-user foo \
      --proxy-pass bar
```

## MTC Configuration
When configuring the source cluster in MTC the API URL takes the form of `https://proxied-cluster.${namespace}.svc.cluster.local`. 

Replace `${namespace}` with either `openvpn` or the namespace you specified when running the command to set up the tunnel.

## Troubleshooting
It may take 3 to 5 minutes after the setup to complete for the load balancer address to become resolvable. During this time the client will be unable to connect and establish a connection and the tunnel will not function.

During this time you can run `oc get pods` in the namespace you specified for setup, and monitor the logs of the openvpn container to see the connection establish.

### Example
`oc logs -f -n openvpn-311 openvpn-7b66f65d48-79dbs -c openvpn`
